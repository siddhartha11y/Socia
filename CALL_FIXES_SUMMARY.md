# 🔧 Call System Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed:

### ✅ 1. **High Quality Audio**
- Added high-quality audio encoding (48kHz, stereo, 128kbps)
- Enabled noise suppression, echo cancellation, and automatic gain control
- Should sound much better now, similar to professional streaming apps

### ✅ 2. **Timer Synchronization** 
- Added `call_connected` event that syncs between both users
- Both caller and receiver will now see the same timer
- Backend now handles `call_connected` event properly

### ✅ 3. **Reduced Duplicate Interfaces**
- Added logic to prevent global call interface from showing when in active chat
- Uses `window.isInActiveCallChat` flag to control visibility

### ✅ 4. **Better Connection Handling**
- Improved user joining/leaving detection
- Better call state management
- More reliable connection status updates

## What You Should See Now:

### Audio Quality:
- 🎵 **Much clearer audio** (48kHz stereo vs previous basic quality)
- 🔇 **No echo or background noise** (automatic echo cancellation)
- 📢 **Consistent volume** (automatic gain control)

### Timer:
- ⏱️ **Both users see the same timer** when call connects
- ⏱️ **Timer starts when both users are connected**
- ⏱️ **Synchronized across all devices**

### Interface:
- 📱 **Only one call interface** should show at a time
- 📱 **Cleaner chat experience** during calls
- 📱 **No duplicate floating boxes**

## Test the Fixes:

1. **Start a new call** between two browsers/devices
2. **Check audio quality** - should be much clearer
3. **Verify timer sync** - both should show same time when connected
4. **No duplicate interfaces** - should only see one call UI

## If Issues Persist:

1. **Refresh both browser tabs**
2. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+F5)
3. **Check browser console** for any error messages
4. **Try different browsers** to test compatibility

The calling system should now be much more reliable and professional! 🚀
